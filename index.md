!!!warning
We are actively updating these notes to reflect the latest exam revision released on August 1st, 2022. The content on these pages will change dynamically as these updates occur. Additionally, we are working to migrate references and sources to their individual pages rather than a centralized page. For this reason, some sources may not be properly cited. Any page displaying :icon-stop: contains the same material from our previous version of notes for the former exam objectives. While these are likely still safe to use for study purposes, they have *not* yet been updated for the latest exam objectives. Any page displaying :icon-alert: is currently under revision and is being updated to align with the latest exam objectives. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to apply these updates.

If you are looking for the old version of these notes, they are still available [here](https://ccsp2019.alukos.com).
