!!!warning Last Update: 2022/10/11 at 1:05 PM EDT
I am actively updating these notes to reflect the latest exam revision released on August 1st, 2022. The content on these pages will change dynamically as these updates occur. Additionally, I am working to migrate references and sources to their individual pages rather than a centralized page. For this reason, some sources may not be properly cited. I appreciate your patience and understanding as I work to apply these updates.

## Purpose

These notes were created to aggregate accurate information from reliable sources to facilitate studying for the (ISC)² Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) exam. While these notes were originally intended for personal use, in accordance with the fourth canon of the [(ISC)² Code of Ethics](https://www.isc2.org/Ethics){ target="_blank" } to "Advance and protect the profession," they have been shared publicly to help the community study for and pass the CCSP.
