## Overview

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a strict data privacy law that was adopted by the European Union (EU) in 2016 and went into effect on May 25, 2018. Though it was drafted and passed by the EU and is binding on all EU member states and members of the European Economic Area (EEA), it applies to any organization targeting or collecting data related to people in the EU. https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/

The GDPR consists of two components: the articals and recitals.

- The articles constitute the legal requirements organizations must follow to demonstrate compliance.
- The recitals provide additional information and supporting context to supplement the articles.

## Recitals

The GDPR contains 173 recitals. It's particularly important to highlight the following recital as it lays the framework upon which GDPR is established:

=== Recital 1 - Data protection as a fundamental right

The protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right. Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the 'Charter') and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. https://gdpr.eu/recital-1-data-protection-as-a-fundamental-right/

===

## Consequences

The GDPR states explicitly that some violations are more severe than others and defines two tiers of severity.

The less severe infringements could result in a fine of up to €10 million, or 2% of the firm’s worldwide annual revenue from the preceding financial year, whichever amount is higher.

The more serious infringements go against the very principles of the right to privacy and the right to be forgotten that are at the heart of the GDPR. These types of infringements could result in a fine of up to €20 million, or 4% of the firm’s worldwide annual revenue from the preceding financial year, whichever amount is higher.

To be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the data controller should implement measures, which meet the principles of data protection by design and data protection by default.

Privacy by design and by default require data protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Such measures include pseudonymizing personal data, by the controller, as soon as possible.

Each member state will establish an independent SA to hear and investigate complaints, sanction administrative offenses, etc.
