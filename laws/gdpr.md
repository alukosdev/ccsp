EEA | European Economic Area
EU | European Union
GDPR | General Data Protection Regulation
SA | Supervisory Authority

## Overview

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, which is binding on all EU member states, as well as members of the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR is also directly binding on any corporation that processes the data of EU citizens.

## Principles

- The concept of consent
- Transfers abroad
- The right to be forgotten (also known as right of erasure)
- Establishment of the role of the data protection officer
- Access requests
- Home state regulation
- Increased sanctions

To be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the data controller should implement measures, which meet the principles of data protection by design and data protection by default.

Privacy by design and by default require data protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Such measures include pseudonymizing personal data, by the controller, as soon as possible.

Each member state will establish an independent SA to hear and investigate complaints, sanction administrative offenses, etc.

### Breaches of Security

The GDPR requires companies to report that they have suffered a breach of security. The reporting requirements are risk-based, and there are different requirements for reporting the breach to the Supervisory Authority and to the affected data subjects. Breaches must be reported within 72 hours of the company becoming aware of the incident.

### Sanctions

Violations of the GDPR expose a company to significant sanctions. These sanctions may reach up to the greater of 4% of their global turnover or gross income, or up to EUR 20 million.
