## Overview

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a strict data privacy law that was adopted by the European Union (EU) in 2016 and went into effect on May 25, 2018. Though it was drafted and passed by the EU and is binding on all EU member states and members of the European Economic Area (EEA), it applies to any organization targeting or collecting data related to people in the EU. https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/

The GDPR consists of two components: the articals and recitals.

- The articles constitute the legal requirements organizations must follow to demonstrate compliance.
- The recitals provide additional information and supporting context to supplement the articles.

To be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the data controller should implement measures, which meet the principles of data protection by design and data protection by default.

Privacy by design and by default require data protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Such measures include pseudonymizing personal data, by the controller, as soon as possible.

Each member state will establish an independent SA to hear and investigate complaints, sanction administrative offenses, etc.
