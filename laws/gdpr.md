## Overview

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a strict data privacy law that was adopted by the European Union (EU) in 2016 and went into effect on May 25, 2018. Though it was drafted and passed by the EU and is binding on all EU member states and members of the European Economic Area (EEA), it applies to any organization targeting or collecting data related to people in the EU. https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/

The GDPR consists of two components: the articals and recitals.

- The articles constitute the legal requirements organizations must follow to demonstrate compliance.
- The recitals provide additional information and supporting context to supplement the articles.

## Articles

The articles of the GDPR are split into several chapters, each of which has their own title. Covered on this page include:

- Chapter 2: Principles (articles 5-11)
- Chapter 3: Rights of the data subject (articles 12-23)

### Principles



!!!danger
I do not know where the following principles. They may be components somewhere within the regulation, but they're *not* the principles.

- The concept of consent
- Transfers abroad
- The right to be forgotten (also known as right of erasure)
- Establishment of the role of the data protection officer
- Access requests
- Home state regulation
- Increased sanctions
!!!

To be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the data controller should implement measures, which meet the principles of data protection by design and data protection by default.

Privacy by design and by default require data protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Such measures include pseudonymizing personal data, by the controller, as soon as possible.

Each member state will establish an independent SA to hear and investigate complaints, sanction administrative offenses, etc.

### Rights

### Breaches of Security

The GDPR requires companies to report that they have suffered a breach of security. The reporting requirements are risk-based, and there are different requirements for reporting the breach to the Supervisory Authority and to the affected data subjects. Breaches must be reported within 72 hours of the company becoming aware of the incident.

## Recitals

The GDPR contains 173 recitals. Covered on this page include:

- Recital 1 - [Data protection as a fundamental right](#data-protection-as-a-fundamental-right)

==- Recital 1 - Data protection as a fundamental right

The protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right. Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the 'Charter') and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.
