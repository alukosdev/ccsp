## Overview

HIPAA is a set of federal laws governing the handling of PHI.

Individuals must *opt in* for data sharing.

### Enforcement

- The DHHS is in charge of managing HIPAA.
- The OCR is the federal enforcement arm of the DHHS.

## Components

### Privacy Rule

The first primary regulation promulgated by the DHHS was the Privacy Rule. It contained language specific to maintaining the privacy of patient information as it was traditionally stored and used, **on paper**.

The patient controls the distribution of their information.

### Security Rule

With the explosion of networking, digital storage, and the Internet came the Security Rule, followed by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009, which provided financial incentives for medical practices and hospitals to convert paper record-keeping systems **to digital**.

The healthcare provider has to protect information based on the privacy the patient has specified.
