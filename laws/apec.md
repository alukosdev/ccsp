## Overview

The APEC is a regional organization meant to work toward economic growth and cooperation of its member nations. APEC agreements are not legally binding and are followed only with voluntary compliance by those entities (usually private companies) that choose to participate. It aims to address privacy as it relates to the following:

- Privacy as an international issue
- Electronic trading environments
- Effects of cross-border data flows

The APEC intent is to enhance the function of free markets through common adherence to PII protection principles. APEC members understand that consumers will not trust markets if their PII is not protected during participation in those markets. Therefore, APEC principles offer reassurance to consumers as an effort to increase faith in trading practices and thereby ensure mutual benefit for all involved.

- Individuals know when their data is used, transmitted, or stored.
- Limitations on usage are based on what is known to the individuals.
- The entity collecting or creating PII has responsibilities toward maintaining data accuracy and integrity.

APEC promotes a consistent approach to information privacy to ensure the free flow of information.
