## Overview

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) is part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 and creates incentives related to health care information technology, including incentives for the use of electronic health record (EHR) systems among providers.

Because HITECH legislation results in an expansion in the exchange of electronic protected health information (ePHI), it also widens the scope of privacy and security protections under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), including increasing legal liability for non-compliance and more enforcement actions.
