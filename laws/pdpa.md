## Overview

In 2000, Argentina passed the Personal Data Protection Act 25.326 with the explicit intent of ensuring adherence and compliance with the EU Data Directive. PDPA, consistent with EU rules, prohibits transferring personal data to countries that do not have adequate protections, such as the United States. Argentina has also enacted a number of laws to supplement the 2000 act.
