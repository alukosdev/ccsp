PDPA | Personal Data Protection Act

## Overview

<span id="rev1"></span>In agreement with the Argentine National Constitution, the Personal Data Protection Act 25.326 (PDPA) was executed in 2000 to help protect the privacy of personal data, and to give individuals access to any information stored in public and private databases and registries.

The PDPA aligns with the European legislative model for protecting data privacy, and Argentina was the first country in Latin America to achieve an 'adequacy' qualification for data transfers from the EU.[[1]](#ref1)
