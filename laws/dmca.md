## Overview

<span id="rev1"></span>In 1998, Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which amended United States (U.S.) copyright law to address important parts of the relationship between copyright and the internet. The three main updates were:

1. Establishing protections for online service providers in certain situations if their users engage in copyright infringement, including by creating the notice-and-takedown system, which allows copyright owners to inform online service providers about infringing material so it can be taken down;
2. Encouraging copyright owners to give greater access to their works in digital formats by providing them with legal protections against unauthorized access to their works (for example, hacking passwords or circumventing encryption); and 
3. Making it unlawful to provide false copyright management information (for example, names of authors and copyright owners, titles of works) or to remove or alter that type of information in certain circumstances.[[1]](#ref1)
