# Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy (TADP) Framework

!!!
On March 25, 2022, the United States (U.S.) and the European Union (EU) announced a political agreement on a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy (TADP) Framework to safeguard commercial cross-border data flows.

## Acronyms, Abbreviations, and Initialisms

BCR | Binding Corporate Rule
DOC | Department of Commerce
EU | European Union
SCC | Standard Contractual Clause
TADP | Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy
U.S. | United States

## Overview

Despite U.S. assurances, many in the EU have remained uneasy about U.S. intelligence and surveillance laws and possible U.S. government access to EU citizens' personal data. The new framework would increase safeguards and limits on U.S. signals intelligence activities, establish a new redress mechanism with independent and binding authority (the Data Protection Review Court), and add oversight procedures for signals intelligence activities.

Participating companies and organizations that take advantage of the TADP Framework to protect data flows would continue to be required to adhere to the [Privacy Shield Principles](/laws/privacy-shield/#principles) and to self-certify through the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC).

EU officials hope that the new TADP Framework will be finalized and adopted by the end of 2022.

Apart from the new framework, U.S. firms have limited options for cross-border data flows with the EU. They include:

- Create Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) that EU officials must approve on a firm-by-firm basis;
- Implement updated EU-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and reassess for adequate safeguards according to the CJEU ruling;
- Use commercial cloud services provided by large technology firms that use approved BCRs or updated SCCs (e.g., Microsoft, IBM);
- Store EU citizens' personal data only in the EU or other approved country, an idea advocated by some European DPAs and other stakeholders, but which others view as potential costly data localization trade barriers;
- Obtain consent from individuals for every single transfer of personal data, a likely logistically challenging and costly option for most entities;
- Exit or limit participation in the EU market.
