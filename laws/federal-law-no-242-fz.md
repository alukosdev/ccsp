# Federal Law No. 242-FZ

## Overview

Federal Law No. 242-FZ, commonly referred to as the "Russian Data Localization Law" introduces amendments to existing Russian laws to further protect the privacy of personal data for citizens of Russia. In particular, the Russian Data Localization Law establishes the following:

> While collecting personal data, for instance by means of the information-telecommunication network "Internet" the operator shall ensure the recording, systematising, accumulating, storing, making more precise (updating, modifying) and retrieving of the personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation by means of databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation.

In other words, personal data of Russian citizens collected by operators must be physically stored within the Russian Federation.
