## Overview

To allow some U.S.-based companies to operate legitimately inside the EU, the EU Data Directive included a set of safe harbor privacy rules designed to outline what American companies must do in order to comply with EU laws. These rules outlined the proper handling of storage and transmission of private information belonging to EU citizens.

- Must voluntarily agree to comply with the Data Directive.
- Must sign up with a federal enforcement entity in the United States that would administer the program.
- Must agree to allow auditing and enforcement by the program administrators.

Any U.S. organization subject to the FTC's jurisdiction and some transportation organizations subject to the jurisdiction of the DoT can participate in the Safe Harbor program. Certain industries, such as telecommunication carriers, banks, and insurance companies, may not be eligible for this program.

### Enforcement

- For most companies, the Safe Harbor program was *administered* by the DoC.
- For the specific industries of airlines and shipping companies, the program was *administered* by the DoT.
- The *enforcement* arm of the DoC is the FTC.

## Principles

Under the Safe Harbor program, U.S. companies have been able to voluntarily adhere to a set of seven principles:

- Notice
- Choice
- Transfers to third parties
- Access
- Security
- Date integrity
- Enforcement

Organizations must also be subject to enforcement and dispute resolution proceedings.
