## Overview

Directive 95/46/EC, also known as the "European Union (EU) Data Protection Directive of 1995," was the first major EU data privacy law. This overarching regulation describes the appropriate handling of personal and private information of all EU citizens. Any entity gathering the PII of any citizen of the EU is subject to the Data Directive. This includes by either automated or paper means.

It does *not* apply to the processing of data in these instances:

- By a natural person in the course of purely personal or household activities
- In the course of an activity that falls outside the scope of community law, such as operations concerning public safety, defense, or state security

Companies must meet special conditions to ensure that they provide an adequate level of data protection if they plan to transfer data to a jurisdiction outside the EEA. Some countries have been approved by the EU commission by virtue of the country's domestic law or of the international commitment it has entered into. These countries include:

- Switzerland
- Australia
- New Zealand
- Argentina
- Israel

U.S. companies that have subscribed to the Privacy Shield principles are also approved for this purpose.

## Principles

The Data Directive addresses individual personal privacy by codifying these seven principles:

- Notice: The individual must be informed that personal information about them is being gathered or created.
- Choice: Every individual can choose whether to disclose their personal information. No entity can gather or create personal information about an individual without that individual's explicit agreement.
- Purpose: The individual must be told the specific use the information will be put to. This includes whether the data will be shared with any other entity.
- Access: The individual is allowed to get copies of any of their own information held by any entity.
- Integrity: The individual must be allowed to correct any of their own information if it is inaccurate.
- Security: Any entity holding an individual's personal information is responsible for protecting that information and is ultimately liable for any unauthorized disclosure of that data.
- Enforcement: All entities that have any personal data of any EU citizen understand that they are subject to enforcement actions by EU authorities.

These principles largely conforms to a set of principles created by the OECD.
