## Overview

In 2002 the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) was enacted as an attempt to prevent fraudulent accounting practices, poor audit practices, inadequate financial controls, and poor oversight by governing boards of directors. It applies to all publicly traded corporations. SOX protects individuals from *accounting errors* and *fraudulent practices* in *publicly traded companies*. It provides for corporate accountability.

SOX is not a set of business practices and does not specify how a business should store records; rather, it defines which records (such as financial records) are to be stored and for how long.

SOX is also known as the "*public company* accounting reform and investor protection act".
