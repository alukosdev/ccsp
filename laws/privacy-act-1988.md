## Overview

The Australian Privacy Act regulates the handling of personal information. It includes details regarding the collection, use, storage, disclosure, access to, and correction of personal information. It consists of fundamental National Privacy Principles (NPP) covering such issues as:

- Transparency in the handling of personal information
- The rules on collecting information from solicitation
- Correctness and integrity of collected data

Within the privacy principles, the following components are addressed for personal information:

- Collection
- Use
- Disclosure
- Access
- Correction
- Identification

Since 2014, the revised Privacy Amendment Act has introduced a new set of principles focusing on the handling of personal information, now called the Australian Privacy Principles (APP). The Privacy Amendment Act requires organizations to put in place SLAs, with an emphasis on security. These SLAs must list the right to audit, reporting requirements, data locations permitted and not permitted, who can access the information, and cross-border disclosure of personal information.

## Components

### APP8 (cross-border disclosure of personal information)

Focuses on regulating the disclosure or transfer of personal information to a separate entity offshore or overseas.

### APP11.1 (security of personal information)

Requires that an organization take reasonable steps to protect the personal information it holds from misuse, interference, and loss from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure.
