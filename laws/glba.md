## Overview

GLBA was created to allow *banks* and *financial institutions* (such as *insurance companies*) to merge. GLBA includes several provisions specifying the kinds of protections and controls that financial institutions are required to use for security customers' account information. The act also requires financial institutions to give customers written privacy notices that explain their information-sharing practices.

Individuals must opt out for data sharing.

GLBA is also known as the "Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999."

## Components

### Financial Privacy Rule

Regulates the collection and disclosure of private financial information.

### Safeguards Rule

Stipulates that financial institutions must implement security programs to protect such information.

### Pretexting Provisions

Prohibits the practice of pretexting (accessing private information using false pretenses).

Some of the provisions include requiring all financial institutions to have a written ISP, and later revisions of FDIC guidance require that an ISO be named and given adequate resources in order to implement the ISP.
