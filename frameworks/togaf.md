TOGAF | The Open Group Architecture Framework

## Overview

The TOGAF Standard is a framework for Enterprise Architecture. It may be used freely by any organization wishing to develop an Enterprise Architecture for use within that organization.[[REF]]https://pubs.opengroup.org/togaf-standard/index.html



TOGAF is one of the many frameworks available to the cloud security professional for designing, planning, implementing, and governing an enterprise Information Technology architecture. TOGAF provides a standardized approach that can be used to address business needs by providing a common lexicon for business communication.

TOGAF is based on *open methods* and approaches to enterprise architecture, allowing the business to avoid a lock-in scenario from the use of proprietary approaches. TOGAF also provides for the ability to quantifiably measure ROI so that the business can use resources more efficiently. Thus, TOGAF is a means to incorporate security architecture with the overall business architecture.

TOGAF relies heavily on modularization, standardization, and already existing, proven technologies and products.

## Domains

There are four architecture domains that are commonly accepted as subsets of an overall Enterprise Architecture, all of which the TOGAF Standard is designed to support:[[REF]]https://pubs.opengroup.org/togaf-standard/introduction/chap03.html

- Business Architecture
- Data Architecture
- Application Architecture
- Technology Architecture

==- Business Architecture

The Business Architecture defines the business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes.

==- Data Architecture

The Data Architecture describes the structure of an organization's logical and physical data assets and data management resources.

==- Application Architecture

The Application Architecture provides a blueprint for the individual applications to be deployed, their interactions, and their relationships to the core business processes of the organization.

==- Technology Architecture

The Technology Architecture describes the digital architecture and the logical software and hardware infrastructure capabilities and standards that are required to support the deployment of business, data, and applications services. This includes digital services, Internet of Things (IoT), social media infrastructure, cloud services, IT infrastructure, middleware, networks, communications, processing, standards, etc.

==-

There are many other domains that could be defined by combining appropriate views of the Business, Data, Application, and Technology domains. For example:

- Information Architecture
- Risk and Security Architectures
- Digital Architecture

The TOGAF framework enables the creation of these multi-dimensional views and categorizes them to create specific domains that enable an enterprise to consider the wider scope of their enterprise and capabilities.
