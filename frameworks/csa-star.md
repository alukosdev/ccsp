## Overview

The CSA STAR program appeared as demand for a single consistent framework for evaluating cloud providers developed.

The CSA STAR program was designed to provide an independent level of program assurance for cloud consumers. Provides a mechanism for users to assess the security of cloud security providers. It allows customers to perform a large component of due diligence and allow a single framework of controls and requirements to be utilized in assessing CSP suitability and the ability to fulfill CSP requirements.

## Components

The CSA STAR program consists of three levels based on the Open Certification Framework.

### STAR Level 1

!!!
This tier is also referred to as STAR Self-Assessment.
!!!

At level one organizations can submit one or both of the security and privacy self-assessments. For the security assessment, organizations use the Cloud Controls Matrix to evaluate and document their security Controls. The privacy assessment submissions are based on the GDPR Code of Conduct.

1. Self-Assessment
2. GDPR Code of Conduct Self-Assessment

#### STAR Level 1 Continuous

1. Continuous Self-Assessment

A CSP that uses a CAIQ to achieve Self-Assessment, a point-in-time assessment, can use a Continuous Self-Assessment to demonstrate effectiveness of controls over a period of time, to achieve STAR Continuous Level 1.

### STAR Level 2

!!!
This tier is also referred to as STAR Attestation and Certification.
!!!

Requires the release and publication of available results of an assessment carried out by an independent third party based on CSA CCM and ISO 27001:2013 or an AICPA SOC 2.

Organizations looking for a third-party audit can choose from one or more of the security and privacy audits and certifications. An organization's location, along with the regulations and standards it is subject to will have the greatest factor in determining which ones are appropriate to pursue.

1. Attestation, Certification, and C-Star

- Attestation includes a third-party individual assessment against SOC 2 standards. This level is a collaboration between CSA and the AICPA to provide guidelines for CPAs to conduct SOC 2 engagements using criteria from the AICPA (Trust Service Principles, AT 101) and the CSA CCM.
- Certification includes a third-party individual assessment against ISO/IEC 27001. This level is a technology-neutral certification that is based on a rigorous, independent third-party assessment of a cloud service provider's security. The certification leverages the requirements of the ISO/IEC 27001 management system standard together with the CSA CCM.
- C-Star Assessment complies with Chinese national standards. This level is an assessment that is based on an independent third-party assessment of a cloud service provider's security for the Greater China market. The assessment harmonizes CSA best practices with Chinese national standards.

2. GDPR Code of Conduct Self-Assessment

#### STAR Level 2 Continuous

1. Level 2 + Continuous Self-Assessment

A CSP, who holds a third-party audit, can achieve STAR Level 2 Continuous by adding a Continuous Self-Assessment, which allows them to quickly inform customers of changes to their security programs, instead of communicating those until the next audit period in normal STAR Level 2.

### STAR Level 3

!!!
This tier is also referred to as STAR Continuous.
!!!

1. Continuous Certification

Requires the release and publication of results related to the security properties of monitoring based on the CloudTrust Protocol.

The CloudTrust protocol is intended to establish a digital trust between a cloud computing customer and provider and create transparency about the providers configurations, vulnerabilities, access, authorization, policy, accountability, anchoring and operating status conditions.

Providers will publish their security practices according to CSA formatting and specifications, including validation of CCM, CTP, and CloudAudit (A6) standards. Customers and tool vendors will retrieve the information in a variety of contexts.

Automate the current security practices of cloud providers. Providers publish their security practices according and customers and tool vendors can retrieve and present this information in avariety of contexts.

A CSP is the most transparent through a continuous, automated process that ensures that security controls are monitored and validated at all times.
