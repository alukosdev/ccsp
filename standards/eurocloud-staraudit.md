# EuroCloud StarAudit

## Overview

The StarAudit scheme evaluates cloud services according to a well-defined and transpaÂ­rent catalogue of criteria. The result of this audit process shows the respective maturity and compliance levels of a service. The certification procedure is based on best practices and provides answers to the fundamental questions managers are likely to ask when looking for a suitable cloud service provider. Unlike pure security or data protection audits, it covers the entire range of cloud service functions and validates compliance against the requirements in clearly understandable terms.
