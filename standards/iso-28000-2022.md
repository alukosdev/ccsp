# ISO 28000:2022: Security and resilience - Security management systems - Requirements

## Acronyms, Abbreviations, and Initialisms

Short Form | Full Form
:--- | :---
ISO | International Organization for Standardization
PDCA | Plan-Do-Check-Act

## Overview

ISO 28000:2022 specifies requirements for a security management system, including those aspects critical to the security assurance of the supply chain. It requires the organization to:

- assess the security environment in which it operates including its supply chain (including dependencies and interdependencies);
- determine if adequate security measures are in place to effectively manage security-related risks;
- manage compliance with statutory, regulatory and voluntary obligations to which the organization subscribes;
- align security processes and controls, including the relevant upstream and downstream processes and controls of the supply chain to meet the organization’s objectives.

ISO 28000:2022 applies the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) model to planning, establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and continually improving the effectiveness of an organization’s security management system.

Function | Description
