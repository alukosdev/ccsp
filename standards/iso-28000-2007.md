## Overview

Focus is to assist organizations in the identification and implementation of controls to safeguard people, products, and assets.

In line with other ISO security-related management systems, ISO 28000 focuses on the use of PDCA as a lifecycle of continual improvement and enhancement.

ISO 28000 defines a set of security management requirements and provides for certification against certain relevant elements that relate to risk:

- Security management policy
- Organizational objectives
- Risk management practices
- Documented practices and records
- Supplier relationships
- Roles, responsibilities, and authorities
- Use of PDCA
- Organizational procedures and processes

Because ISO 28000 defines a set of security management requirements, the onus is on the organization to establish a security management system that meets the standard's requirements.
