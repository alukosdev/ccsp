## Overview

The TCI Reference Architecture is both a methodology and a set of tools that enable security architects, enterprise architects and risk management professionals to leverage a common set of solutions that fulfill their common needs to be able to assess where their internal IT and their cloud providers are in terms of security capabilities and to plan a roadmap to meet the security needs of their business.

TCI helps cloud providers develop industry-recommended, secure and interoperable IAM configurations, and practices. The CSA TCI helps CSPs develop identity, access, and compliance management guidelines.

## Mission Statement

To promote research, development, and education of best practices and methodologies around a reference architecture for a secure and trusted cloud.

## Principles

- Define protections that enable trust in the cloud.
- Develop cross-platform capabilities and patterns for proprietary and open-source providers.
- Facilitate trusted and efficient access, administration and resiliency to the customer/consumer.
- Provide direction to secure information that is protected by regulations.
- Facilitate proper and efficient governance, identification, authentication, authorization, administration and auditability.
- Centralize security policy, maintenance operation and oversight functions.
- Access to information must be secure yet still easy to obtain.
- Delegate or federate access control where appropriate.
- Must be easy to adopt and consume, supporting the design of security patterns.
- Must be elastic, flexible and resilient supporting multitenant, multi-landlord platforms.
- Must address and support multiple levels of protection, including network, operating system, and application security needs.
