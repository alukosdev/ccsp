> Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program

## Overview

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. FedRAMP enables Agencies to rapidly adapt from old, insecure legacy IT to mission-enabling, secure, and cost effective cloud-based IT. FedRAMP created and manages a core set of processes to ensure effective, repeatable cloud security for the government.

The FedRAMP standard dictates that American federal agencies must retain their data within the boundaries of the United States, including data within cloud datacenters.
