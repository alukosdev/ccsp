| NIST | National Institute of Standards and Technology |

## Overview

The framework provides a common taxonomy and mechanism for organizations to:

- Describe their current cybersecurity posture
- Describe their target state for cybersecurity
- Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the context of a continuous and repeatable process
- Assess progress toward the target state
- Communicate among internal and external stakeholders about cybersecurity risk
