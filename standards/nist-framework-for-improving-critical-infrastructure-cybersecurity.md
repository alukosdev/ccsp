# NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity

## Quick Reference

| Acronym | Backronym |
| - | - |
| NIST | National Institute of Standards and Technology |

## Overview

The framework provides a common taxonomy and mechanism for organizations to:

- Describe their current cybersecurity posture
- Describe their target state for cybersecurity
- Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the context of a continuous and repeatable process
- Assess progress toward the target state
- Communicate among internal and external stakeholders about cybersecurity risk

!!!
This framework is ideal to use as a supplement to best coding practices and code reviews and testing, but also functions as an approach to risk mitigation.

## Components

### Framework Core

Cybersecurity activities and outcomes divided into five functions:

- Identify
- Protect
- Detect
- Respond
- Recover

#### Identify (ID)

Contains two categories:

- Asset Management (ID.AM)
  - ID.AM-2. Software platforms and applications within the organization are inventoried.
  - ID.AM-3. Organizational communication and data flows are mapped.
  - ID.AM-5. Resources (such as hardware, devices, data, and software) are prioritized based on their classification, criticality, and business value.
- Risk Assessment (ID.RA)
  - ID.RA-1. Asset vulnerabilities are identified and documented.
  - ID.RA-5. Threats, vulnerabilities, likelihoods, and impacts are used to determine risk.

### Framework Profile

Used to assist the organization in aligning activities with business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources.

### Framework Implementation Tiers

Used to identify where the organization is with regard to their particular approach.
