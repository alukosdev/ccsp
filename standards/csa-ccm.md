## Quick Reference

| Acronym | Backronym |
| - | - |
| CCM | Cloud Controls Matrix |
| CSA | Cloud Security Alliance |

## Overview

The CCM is designed to provide *guidance* for cloud vendors and to assist cloud customers with assessing the overall security risk of a CSP. Can be used to perform security control audits.

The CSA CCM is an essential and up-to-date security controls framework that is addressed to the cloud community and stakeholders. A fundamental richness of the CCM is its ability to provide *mapping* and *cross relationships* with the main industry-accepted security standards, regulations, and controls frameworks (such as ISO 27001/27002, ISACA COBIT, and PCI DSS).

The CSA CCM framework gives organizations the necessary structure relating to information security tailored to the cloud industry.

The CCM allows you to note where specific controls (some of which you might already have in place) will address requirements listed in multiple regulatory and contractual standards, laws, and guides.

!!!
The CSA CCM can be particularly useful for assisting with supply chain reviews.
