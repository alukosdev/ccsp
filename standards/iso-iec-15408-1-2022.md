## Overview

ISO/IEC 15408-1:2022 establishes the general concepts and principles of IT security evaluation and specifies the general model of evaluation given by various parts of the standard which in its entirety is meant to be used as the basis for evaluation of security properties of IT products.

!!!
ISO/IEC 15408-1:2022 is designed for evaluating the security properties of IT products, not administrative or business processes. Additionally, if a product is misconfigured or improperly managed, it does not guarantee a certain level of security.
!!!

## Protection Profiles

Protection profiles define a standard set of security requirements for a specific type of product, such as a firewall, IPS/IDS, or UTM.

## Evaluation Assurance Levels (EALs)

EALs define how thoroughly the product is tested. EALs are rated using a sliding scale from 1-7, with 1 being the lowest-level evaluation and 7 being the highest.

The higher the level of evaluation, the more QA tests the product would have undergone; however, undergoing more tests does not necessarily mean the product is more secure.

EAL | Description
:--- | :---
EAL1 | Functionally tested
EAL2 | Structurally tested
EAL3 | Methodically tested and checked
EAL4 | Methodically designed, tested, and reviewed
EAL5 | Semiformally designed and tested
EAL6 | Semiformally verified design and tested
EAL7 | Formally verified design and tested

## Process

There are three steps to successfully submit a product for evaluation according to the Common Criteria:

1. The vendor must detail the security features of a product using what is called a Security Target (ST).
2. The product, along with the ST, goes to a certified laboratory for testing according to evaluate how well it meets the specifications defined in the protection profile.
3. A successful evaluation leads to an official certification of the product.

## Noteworthy

- [x] ISO/IEC 15408-1:2022 is better known as the the Common Criteria (CC) or more formally, the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluations.
- [x] ISO/IEC 15408-1:2022 introduces the concept of Protection Profiles (PPs) and Evaluation Assurance Levels (EALs).
- [x] There are 7 EALs which should be committed to memory.
