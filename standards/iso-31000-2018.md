## Overview

Key components of ISO 31000 are designing, implementing, and reviewing risk management. The key requirement of ISO 31000 is management endorsement, support, and commitment. A key concept in ISO 31000 involves risk management being an embedded component as opposed to a separate activity.

ISO 31000 is an international standard that focuses on designing, implementing, and reviewing risk management processes and practices. It is not intended for certification purposes; implementing it does not address specific or legal requirements related to risk assessments, risk reviews, and overall risk management. The standard explains that proper implementation of a risk management process can be used to:

- Create and protect value
- Integrate organizational procedures
- Be part of the decision-making process
- Explicitly address uncertainty
- Be a systematic, structured, and timely risk management program
- Ensure the risk management program is based on the best available information
- Be tailored to the organization's business requirements and actual risks
- Take human and cultural factors into account
- Ensure the risk management program is transparent and inclusive
- Create a risk management program that is dynamic, iterative, and responsive to change
- Facilitate continual improvement and enhancement of the organization
