# ISO/IEC 17789:2014: Information technology - Cloud computing - Reference architecture

## Acronyms, Abbreviations, and Initialisms

Short Form | Full Form
:--- | :---
CCRA | Cloud Computing Reference Architecture
IEC | International Electrotechnical Commission
ISO | International Organization for Standardization

## Overview

ISO/IEC 17789:2014 specifies the cloud computing reference architecture (CCRA). The reference architecture includes the cloud computing roles, cloud computing activities, and the cloud computing functional components and their relationships.

The CCRA can serve as a fundamental reference point for cloud computing standardization and which provides an overall framework for the basic concepts and principles of a cloud computing system.

!!!
ISO/IEC 17789:2014 is similar to [NIST SP 800-145](/standards/nist-sp-800-145.md) in that it defines several components of cloud computing. Note, however, that their contents and definitions are not quite identical.

## Concepts

### User view of cloud computing

The user view addresses the following cloud computing concepts:

- [Cloud computing activities](#cloud-computing-activities)
- [Roles and sub-roles](#roles-and-sub-roles)
- [Parties](#parties)
- [Cloud services](#cloud-services)
- [Cloud deployment models](#cloud-deployment-models)
- [Cross-cutting aspects](#cross-cutting-aspects)

==- Cloud computing activities

A cloud computing activity is defined as a specified pursuit or set of tasks.

==- Roles and sub-roles

A role is a set of cloud computing activities that serve a common purpose.

In the CCRA, three roles have been defined:

- Cloud service customer (CSC): A party which is in a business relationship for the purpose of using cloud services.
- Cloud service provider (CSP): A party which makes cloud services available.
- Cloud service partner (CSN): A party which is engaged in support of, or auxiliary to, activities of either the cloud service provider or the cloud service customer, or both.

A sub-role is a subset of the cloud computing activities for a given role.

Different sub-roles can share the cloud computing activities associated with a given role.

==- Parties

A party is a natural person or legal person, whether or not incorporated, or a group of either. Parties in a cloud computing system are its stakeholders.

A party can assume more than one role at any given point in time and can engage in a specific subset of activities of that role. Examples of parties include, but are not limited to, large corporations, small and medium sized enterprises, government departments, academic institutions and private citizens.

==- Cloud services

Cloud services are the essential elements of cloud computing.

Cloud services can be described in terms of the cloud capabilities types which they offer, based on the resources provided by the cloud service. There are three cloud capabilities types:

- Application capabilities type
- Platform capabilities type
- Infrastructure capabilities type

Cloud services are also grouped into categories, where each category is a group of cloud services that possess a common set of qualities. The services in these categories can include capabilities from one or more of the cloud capabilities types above.

Representative cloud service categories include:

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- Platform as a service (PaaS)
- Software as a service (SaaS)
- Network as a service (NaaS)

==- Cloud deployment models

Cloud deployment models are a way in which cloud computing can be organized based on the control and sharing of physical or virtual resources.

The cloud deployment models include:

- Public cloud
- Private cloud
- Community cloud
- Hybrid cloud

==- Cross-cutting aspects

Cross-cutting aspects are behaviours or capabilities which need to be coordinated across roles and implemented consistently in a cloud computing system.

Cross-cutting aspects can be shared and can impact multiple roles, cloud computing activities and functional components.

Cross-cutting aspects of cloud computing described in clause 8.5 include:

- Auditability
- Availability
- Governance
- Interoperability
- Maintenance and versioning
- Performance
- Portability
- Protection of personally identifiable information
- Regulatory
- Resiliency
- Reversibility
- Security
- Service levels and service level agreement

==-

### Functional view of cloud computing

The functional view is a technology-neutral view of the functions necessary to form a cloud computing system. The functional view describes the distribution of functions necessary for the support of cloud computing activities.

## Roles

## Cross-Cutting Aspects



## Noteworthy

- [x] ISO/IEC 17789:2014 specifies the cloud computing reference architecture (CCRA). The reference architecture includes the cloud computing roles, cloud computing activities, and the cloud computing functional components and their relationships.

## Overview

ISO/IEC 17789:2014 defines the Cloud Computing Reference Architecture (CCRA) which includes the cloud computing roles, cloud computing activities, and the cloud computing functional components and their relationships.

An activity is a set of tasks that accomplish a goal.

According to ISO/IEC 17789, the three main groups of cloud service activities are:

- Activities that use services
- Activities that provide services
- Activities that support services

ISO/IEC 17789 defines three major roles that perform groups of activities in cloud computing. The activity roles are:

- Cloud service customer (CSC)
- Cloud service provider (CSP)
- Cloud service partner (CSN)

The CSC role includes the cloud service user, cloud service administrator, cloud service business manager, and cloud service integrator sub-roles. These sub-roles govern several activities.

The CSP role includes the cloud service manager, cloud service operations manager, cloud service deployment manager, cloud service business manager, cloud service security and risk manager, customer support and care representative, inter-cloud provider, and the network provider sub-roles. These sub-roles govern several activities.

The CSN role includes cloud service developer, cloud auditor, and cloud service broker sub-roles. These sub-roles govern several activities.
