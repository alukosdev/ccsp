## Overview

ISO/IEC 17789:2014 defines the Cloud Computing Reference Architecture (CCRA) which includes the cloud computing roles, cloud computing activities, and the cloud computing functional components and their relationships.

An activity is a set of tasks that accomplish a goal.

According to ISO/IEC 17789, the three main groups of cloud service activities are:

- Activities that use services
- Activities that provide services
- Activities that support services

ISO/IEC 17789 defines three major roles that perform groups of activities in cloud computing. The activity roles are:

- Cloud service customer (CSC)
- Cloud service provider (CSP)
- Cloud service partner (CSN)

The CSC role includes the cloud service user, cloud service administrator, cloud service business manager, and cloud service integrator sub-roles. These sub-roles govern several activities.

The CSP role includes the cloud service manager, cloud service operations manager, cloud service deployment manager, cloud service business manager, cloud service security and risk manager, customer support and care representative, inter-cloud provider, and the network provider sub-roles. These sub-roles govern several activities.

The CSN role includes cloud service developer, cloud auditor, and cloud service broker sub-roles. These sub-roles govern several activities.
