# Glossary

!!!
Terms on this page are collapsed by default to allow for flashcard-style studying.
!!!

## A

==- Access Control
Access control is restricting access to resources.
==- Access Management
Access management is the process of managing access to resources.
==- Affinity
Grouping of resources.
==- Agreed-Upon Procedures (AUP)
An agreed-upon procedure is a standard a company or client outlines when it hires an external party to perform an audit on a specific test or business process. The procedures, which are called audit standards, are designed and agreed upon by the entity conducting the audit, as well as any appropriate third parties.

!!!
The auditor does not provide an opinion; rather, the entities or third parties form their own conclusions based on the report.
!!!
==- Anti-affinity
Separation of resources.
==- Apache CloudStack
Apache CloudStack creates, manages, and deploys clouds. It is an open-source application. It is software utilized to deploy and manage large networks of virtual machines, that need to be highly available.

It is deployed as a highly scalable IaaS computing platform.
==- API Gateway
An API gateway translates requests from clients into multiple requests to many microservices and delivers the content as a whole via an API it assigns to that client/session.

API gateways can provide access control, rate limiting, logging, metrics, and security filtering services.
==- Application Accreditation
The application has been approved by management.
==- Application Certification
The application meets technical requirements.
==- Attributes
Attributes are facets of an identity. Attributes can be relatively static (like an organizational unit) or highly dynamic (IP address, device being used, if the user authenticated with MFA, location, etc.).
==- Auditability
Auditability is collecting and making available necessary evidence related to the operation and use of the cloud.
==- Authentication
Authentication is the process of confirming an identity. When you log in to a system you present a username (the identifier) and password (an attribute we refer to as an authentication factor).

!!!
Authentication is often referred to as AuthN.
!!!
==- Authoritative Source
An authoritative source is the root source of an identity, such as the directory server that manages employee identities.

!!!
==-

## B

==- Bastion Host
A bastion host is a method for remote access to a secure environment. The bastion host is an extremely hardened device that is typically focused on providing access to one application or for one particular usage. Having the device set up in this focused manner makes hardening it more effective. Bastion hosts are made publicly available on the Internet.

!!!
The difference between a jump server and a bastion host is that a jump server is intended to breach the gap between two security zones and have a gateway to obtain access to something inside of the other security zone. A bastion host is outside of your security zone and will require additional security considerations.

==- Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
The business continuity plan allows a business to plan what it needs to do to ensure that its key products and services *continue to be delivered* in case of a disaster.

Business continuity plans typically outline how to maintain or "continue" business operations back to the point of permanent operations. It allows an enterprise to plan what is necessary to ensure that its key products and services will "continue" to be available in the event of a disaster, and that disruption to the business is minimized as much as possible.

!!!
The BCP is *not* critical to the continuation of services in the event of a business interruption. BC, however, *is*. The BCP is drafted to support BC.
!!!
==- Business Requirements

!!!
==- Data Custodian
Data custodians are responsible for the safe custody, transport, data storage, and implementation of business rules. This is any organization or person who manipulates, stores, or moves the data on behalf of the data owner.

The custodian is usually a specific entity in charge of maintaining and securing the privacy-related data on a *daily basis*, as an element of the data's use; for example, this could be a database administrator hired by the CSP.

The data custodian must adhere to any policies set forth by the data owner in regard to the use of the data.

!!!
In the cloud context, the data custodian is usually the **cloud service provider.** From an international perspective, the data custodian is also known as the **data processor.**
!!!
==- Data Owner
The entity that holds the legal rights and control over a set of data. Data owners define distribution and associated policies.

==-

## G

==- Gap Analysis
To create an accurate frame of reference, a gap analysis is conducted. This is like a lightweight audit in that there are generally findings of weaknesses or vulnerabilities, but the purpose is to identify those weaknesses so they can be remediated prior to any actual audit work. It also provides a starting point for those organizations in the early stages of an information system program development, providing them with a clear starting point.

Gap analysis benchmarks and identifies relevant gaps against specified frameworks or standards. This includes reviewing the organization's current position/performance as revealed by an audit against a given standard.

The value of such an assessment is often determined based on what you did not know or for an independent resource to communicate to relevant management or senior personnel such risks, as opposed to internal resources saying what you need or should be doing.

Typically, resources or personnel who are not engaged or functioning within the area of scope perform gap analysis. The use of independent or impartial resources is best served to ensure there are no conflicts or favoritism. Perspectives gained from people outside the audit target are invaluable because they may see possibilities and opportunities revealed by the audit, whereas the personnel in the target department may be constrained by habit and tradition.
==- Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)

GAAP is a combination of authoritative standards (set by policy boards) and the commonly accepted ways of recording and reporting accounting information. GAAP aims to improve the clarity, consistency, and comparability of the communication of financial information.

==- Honeynet
Grouping multiple honeypot systems to form a network that is used in the same manner as the honeypot, but with more scalability and functionality.
==- Honeypot
Honeypots are computer systems setup to look like production systems using the modern concept of deception. They contain an operating system and can mimic many common systems such as Apache or IIS web servers, Windows file shares, or Cisco routers. A honeypot could be deployed with a known vulnerability that an attacker would be enticed to exploit. While it appears vulnerable to attack, it is in fact protection the real systems from attack while gathering defensive information such as the attacker's identity, access, and compromise methods.

Used to detect, deflect, or in some manner counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems.

Enticement vs. entrapment. The real term to be used should be "distract".

==- IPsec
IPsec is a framework for providing secure transmission of sensitive information over unsecured networks such as the Internet. IPSec works at the network layer, protecting and authenticating IP packets between participating IPsec endpoints.

IPsec can provide the following network security services:

- Confidentiality by encrypting packets before sending them across a network.
- Integrity by authenticating packets sent to ensure that the data has not been altered during transmission.
- Authentication of the source of the IPsec packets sent.
- Antireplay by detected and rejected replayed packets.

Downsides to IPsec:

- IPsec adds overhead to network traffic
- Not NAT friendly

!!!
IPsec does not always tunnel traffic. GRE is a technology leveraged by IPsec that performs tunneling. IKE is another aspect of IPsec that provides encryption.
!!!
==-

## J

==- Jump Server
A jump server, jump host or jump box is a system on a network used to access and manage devices in a separate security zone. A jump server is a hardened and monitored device that spans two dissimilar security zones and provides a controlled means of access between them. The most common example is managing a host in a DMZ from trusted networks or computers.

!!!
The difference between a jump server and a bastion host is that a jump server is intended to breach the gap between two security zones and have a gateway to obtain access to something inside of the other security zone. A bastion host is outside of your security zone and will require additional security considerations.
!!!

The RPO indicates the amount of acceptable data loss measured in terms of how much data can be lost before the business is too adversely affected.

The point in time at which you would like to restore to. For instance, if an organization performs daily full backups and the BCDR plan includes a goal of resuming critical operations using the last full backup, the RPO would be 24 hours.

*Data replication strategies will most affect this metric*, as the choice of strategy will determine how much recent data is available for recovery purposes.
!!!
RPO is measured in *time*.
!!!
==- Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
The RTO indicates the amount of system downtime defining the total time of the disaster until the business can resume operations.

This is the goal for recovery of operational capability after an interruption in service (i.e., the amount of time it takes to recover). For example, a company might have an MAD of one week, while the company's BCDR plan includes and supports an RTO of six days.

!!!
RTO is measured in *time*. The RTO must be lower than the MAD.
!!!
==- Recovery Service Level (RSL)
The recovery service level is a *percentage measurement (0-100%)* of how much computing power is necessary based on the percentage of the production system needed during a disaster.

For example, an RSL of 50% would specify that the DR system would need to operate at a minimum of 50% the performance level of the normal production system.

!!!
RSL is measured in *percentage*.
!!!
==- Reduced Sign-On (RSO)
Not to be confused with SSO or federated SSO, RSO refers to not having to sign into each piece of data or store once authorization has been granted. It generally operates through some form of credential synchronization. RSO introduces security issues not experienced by SSO because the nature of SSO eliminates usernames and other sensitive data from traversing the network.

!!!
The foundation of federation relies on the existence of an identity provider; therefore, RSO has no place in a federated identity system.
!!!
==- Redundancy
Deploying duplicate devices that can take over active operation if the primary device fails.
==- Regression Testing
Re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change. If not, that would be called a regression.
==- Reservations
A reservation creates a guaranteed *minimum* resource allocation that the host must meet.
==- Resiliency
The ability to restore normal operations after a disruptive event. Redundancy is the foundation of resiliency.
==- Return on Investment (ROI)
A term used to describe a profitability ratio.

Generally calculated by dividing net profit by net assets.
==- Role
Identities can have multiple roles which indicate context. “Role” is a confusing and abused term used in many different ways. For our purposes we will think of it as similar to a persona, or as a subset of a persona. For example, a given developer on a given project may have different roles, such as “super-admin” and “dev”, which are then used to make access decisions.

## S

==- Sandboxing
- Testing untested or untrusted code
- To better understand if an application is working the way it was intended to work
==- Scalability
New computing resources can be assigned and allocated without any significant additional capital investment on the part of the cloud provider, and at an incremental cost to the cloud customer.
==- Scoping
Scoping is the process that refers to including only departments or business units impacted by any (cloud) engagement.
==- Security
The owner's right to determine to whom information is disclosed. Security protects privacy.
==- Separation of Duties
Dictates that one person/entity cannot complete an entire transaction alone.

In the case of encryption, a single entity should not be able to administer the issuing of keys, encrypt the data, and store the keys, because this could lead to a situation where that entity has the ability to access or take encrypted data.
==- Server Replication
Concerned more about the processing system rather than the data being replicated.
==- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
Views software as a combination of interoperable services, the components of which can be substituted at will.
==- Service Levels
Service levels indicate the minimum expected performance.
==- Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML)
A method for automating account creation.

- Standardized
- Seldom implemented due to inflexibility and lack of vendor support
- Older and uses XML, which is slow
==- Severity Assessment
Performed by the customer organization to determine the importance of a particular patch or update.
==- Shadow IT
Money spent on technology to acquire services without the IT department's dollars or knowledge.

For example, on-demand self service promotes and allows the ability to provision computing resources without human interaction, The consumer can provision resources regardless of location and time. This can be a challenge to purchasing departments as the typical purchasing processes can be avoided.
==- Shares
The concept of shares is used to arbitrate the issues associated with compute resource *contention* situations. Share values are used to prioritize compute resource access for all guests assigned a certain number of shares. Shares allow the cluster's *reservations* to be allocated and then addresses any remaining resources that may be available for use by members of the cluster through a prioritized percentage-based allocation mechanism.
==- Silos
The configuration when an enterprise deploys applications in dedicated infrastructure.

Having silos in an enterprise deployment could be a precursor to migrating the environments to the cloud.
==- Simplicity
Usage and administration of cloud services ought to be transparent to cloud customers and users; from their perspective, a digital data service is paid for and can be used, with very little additional input other than what is necessary to perform their duties.
==- Smurf Attack
The Smurf attack is a distributed denial-of-service attack in which large numbers of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets with the intended victim’s spoofed source IP are broadcast to a computer network using an IP broadcast address. Most devices on a network will, by default, respond to this by sending a reply to the source IP address. If the number of machines on the network that receive and respond to these packets is very large, the victim’s computer will be flooded with traffic.
==- Snarfing
The action of grabbing data and using it without the owner's consent.
==- Software Assurance
Encompasses the development and implementation of methods and processes for ensuring that software functions as intended while mitigating the risks of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or defects that could bring harm to the end user.
==- Software-Defined Security
Automates security controls.
==- Source Code Analysis (SCA)
Performing an analysis of the source code, byte code, and binaries.
==- Sprawl
A phenomenon that occurs when the number of VMs on a network reaches a point where the administrators can no longer manage them effectively.

Sprawl is a virtualization risk that occurs when the amount of content grows to such a degree that management is near impossible.

To prevent sprawl, the administrator should define and enforce a process for the deployment of VMs and create a library of standardized VM image files.
==- Step-Up Authentication
Step-up authentication is an additional factor or procedure that validates a user's identity by using the following means:

- Challenge questions
- Out-of-band authentication (phone call or SMS)
- Dynamic knowledge-based authentication (questions unique to the end user)
==-
==- Storage Replication
Works with a local service to store or archive data to secondary storage using a SAN. This would typically be in the same location.
==- System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)
SCIM is a standard for exchanging identity information between domains. It can be used for provisioning and deprovisioning accounts in external systems and for exchanging attribute information.

- Standardized
- Open standard for automating the exchange of user identity information between identity domains or IT systems
- Newer than SPML

## T

==- Tenancy Separation
Tenants, while running on the same host, are maintained separately in their virtual environments. This is known as tenancy separation.
==- TLS Authentication
When the server proves its identity to the client.
==- Trust Zones/Security Zones
A trust zone is a network segment within which data flows relatively freely, whereas data flowing in and out of the trust zone is subject to stronger restrictions. These could be physical, logical, or virtual boundaries around network resources, such as:

- DMZ (semi-trusted)
- Department-specific zones/site-specific zones
- Application-defined zones (such as web application tiers)

Before a cloud provider can implement trust zones, they must undergo threat and vulnerability assessments to determine where their weaknesses are within the environment. This will help to determine where trust zones would be most helpful.

When controls implemented by the virtualization components are deemed to be not strong enough, trust zones can be used to segregate the physical infrastructure.

To protect trust zones:

- Implement granular role-based controls on traffic, users, and assets
- Manage inter-zone communications including between sub-zones
- Enforce policy and regulations
- Protect, detect, and contain

==- Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
A physical chip on a host device which stores RSA encryption keys specific to that host for hardware authentication. The purpose is to provide WDE in the event that a hard drive is removed from its host.

!!!
The key difference between HSM and TPM is that an HSM manages keys for several devices, whereas a TPM is specific to a single device.

==- XML Gateway
XML gateways transform how services and sensitive data are exposed as APIs to developers, mobile users, and the cloud. They can be either hardware or software based and they can implement security controls such as DLP, antivirus, and antimalware. XML gateways can also act as a reverse proxy and perform content inspection on many traffic protocols, including SFTP.
