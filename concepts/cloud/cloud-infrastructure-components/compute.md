# Compute

## Glossary

==- Affinity
Grouping of resources.
==- Anti-affinity
Separation of resources.
==- Compute Parameters
A cloud serverâ€™s compute parameters depend on the number of *CPUs* and the amount of *RAM* used. The ability to allocate these resources is a vital compute concern.
==- Limits
A limit creates a *maximum* ceiling for a resource allocation.
==- Reservations
A reservation creates a guaranteed *minimum* resource allocation that the host must meet.
==- Shares
The concept of shares is used to arbitrate the issues associated with compute resource *contention* situations. Share values are used to prioritize compute resource access for all guests assigned a certain number of shares. Shares allow the cluster's *reservations* to be allocated and then addresses any remaining resources that may be available for use by members of the cluster through a prioritized percentage-based allocation mechanism.
