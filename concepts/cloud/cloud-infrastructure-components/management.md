# Management

Management of cloud infrastructure components is performed using a dedicated management plane. The management plane allows for cloud providers to manage all resources from a centralized location instead of needing to log into each individual server when needing to perform tasks. The management plane is typically hosted on its own dedicated server.

The cloud management plane will allow monitoring and administration of the cloud network. Functions of the cloud management plane include:

- Configuration management and services lifecycle management
- Services registry and discovery
- Monitoring, logging and auditing
- SLA management
- Security services and infrastructure management
