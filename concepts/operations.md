## Availability Management

### Overview

Availability management aims to define, analyze, plan, measure, and improve all aspects of the availability of IT services. It is also responsibility for ensuring that all IT infrastructure, processes, tools, roles, and so on, are appropriate for the agreed-upon availability targets.

Most virtualization platforms allow for the management of system availability and can act in the event of a system outage (such as vMotion).

### Operational Relationships

In relation to *release and deployment management*:

If the release were not to go as planned, any negative impacts on system availability would have to be identified, monitored, and remediated as per the existing SLAs for the services and systems affected.

### Overview

Business continuity management *deals with planning, redundancy, criticality analysis, and sustaining the long-term operations of the business*.

BCM is focused on the planning steps that businesses engage in to ensure that their mission-critical systems are able to be restored to service following a disaster or service interruption event.

To focus BCM activities correctly, a prioritized ranking or listing of systems and services must be created and maintained. This is accomplished through the BIA, which identifies and produces a prioritized listing of systems and services critical to the normal functioning of the business.

## Capacity Management

### Overview

Capacity management *deals with scalability and elasticity*.

Capacity management is focused on ensuring that the business IT infrastructure is adequately provisioned to deliver the agreed service-level targets in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Capacity management considers all resources required to deliver IT services within the scope of the defined business requirements. System capacity must be monitored and thresholds must be set to prevent systems from reaching an over-capacity situation.
