==- Step-Up Authentication

- Dynamic knowledge-based authentication (questions unique to the end user)

## Summary

Authentication requires a match against a template or a known quantity. Therefore, variables (such as variable keystrokes) aren't useful for authentication.

Multifactor authentication requires at least two of the following:

*Type 1*: Something you know
*Type 2*: Something you have
*Type 3*: Something you are

In some cases, a fourth factor is mentioned:

- *Type 4*: Something you do (linked to something you are); physiological and behavioral, such as how you write or type.

This field is constantly evolving, and additional considerations include:

- Time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs)
- Somewhere you are (location based)
