# Risk Management

## Summary

Every decision we make should be based on risk. Risk management in the cloud is based on the *shared responsibilities* model.

There are four steps to adequately managing risk:

1. Framing Risk
2. Assessing Risk
3. Responding to Risk
4. Monitoring Risk

## Framing Risk

Addresses how organizations describe the environment in which risk-based decisions are made. Refers to determine what risk and levels are to be evaluated.

Risk framing is designed to produce a risk-management strategy intended to address how organizations assess, respond to, and monitor risk. This allows the organization to clearly articulate the risks that it needs to manage, and it establishes the boundaries for risk-based decisions within organizations.

## Assessing Risk

## Responding to Risk

## Monitoring Risk
