# Risk Management

## Summary

Every decision we make should be based on risk. Risk management in the cloud is based on the *shared responsibilities* model.

There are four steps to adequately managing risk:

1. Risk Framing
2. Assessing Risk
3. Responding to Risk
4. Monitoring Risk

## Framing Risk

Addresses how organizations describe the environment in which risk-based decisions are made. Refers to determine what risk and levels are to be evaluated.

Risk framing is designed to produce a risk-management strategy intended to address how organizations assess, respond to, and monitor risk. This allows the organization to clearly articulate the risks that it needs to manage, and it establishes the boundaries for risk-based decisions within organizations.

## Assessing Risk

## Responding to Risk

Risk response provides a consistent, organization-wide response to risk in accordance with the organizational risk frame by taking these steps:

- Developing alternative courses of action for responding to risk
- Evaluating the alternative courses of action
- Determining appropriate courses of action consistent with organizational risk tolerance
- Implementing risk responses based on selected courses of action

Organizations have four primary ways to address risk, all of which should take into effect the cost-benefit analysis (the potential cost should not outweigh the benefit). For example, we do not put a $10 lock on a $5 bicycle:

1. Avoidance
2. Acceptance
3. Transference
4. Mitigation
5. Rejection

### Avoidance

Leaving a business opportunity because the risk is simply too high and cannot be compensated for with adequate control mechanisms-a risk that exceeds the organization's appetite.

!!!
This is the only surefire method for eliminating a specific risk.
!!!

### Acceptance

The opposite of avoidance; the risk falls within the organization's risk appetite, so the organization continues operations without any additional efforts regarding the risk.

The only reason organizations accept any level of risk is because of the potential benefit also afforded by a risky activity. Risk is often balanced by corresponding *opportunity*.

!!!
If the risk of the activity is estimated to be within the organization's risk appetite, then the organization might choose risk acceptance.
!!!

### Transference

The organization pays someone else to accept the risk, at a lower cost than the potential impact that would result from the risk being realized; this is usually in the form of insurance. This type of risk is often associated with things that have a low probability of occurring but a high impact should they occur.

This typically takes the form of insurance, but contracts and SLAs are another method of transferring risk.

### Mitigation

The organization takes steps to decrease the likelihood or the impact of the risk (and often both); this can take the form of controls/countermeasures, and is usually where security practitioners are involved.

When we choose to mitigate risk by applying countermeasures and controls, the remaining, leftover risk is called residual risk. The task of the security program is to reduce residual risk until it falls within the acceptable level of risk according to the organization's risk appetite.

### Rejection

Risk rejection isn't a legitimate form of risk response. Rejection involves ignoring risks and continuing with operations. This is essentially the same thing as accepting a risk without mitigating it to a tolerable level. In most cases, this would indicate failure of due diligence and may put the organization in a position of liability.
