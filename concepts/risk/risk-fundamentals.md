## Risk Identification

`Risk = Asset * Threat * Vulnerability` (in some cases, the asset is excluded from the calcuation and shouldn't be)

What the above calculation displays is that if there is no threat, no there is no vulnerability. Likewise, if there is no vulnerability, there is no risk. Finally, if the asset has no value, there is also no risk.
