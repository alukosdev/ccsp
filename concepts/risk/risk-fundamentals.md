Examples include personnel background checks, scheduled routine log reviews, mandatory vacations, robust and comprehensive security policies and procedures, and deciding business processes so that there are no single points of failure and so that proper separation of duties exists.
!!!

### Technical

Technical (logical) controls, are those controls that enhance some facets of the CIA triad, usually operating within a system, often in electronic fashion.

!!!
Technical controls include encryption mechanisms, access control lists to limit user permissions, and audit trails and logs of system activity.
