## Summary

Risk identification is the process of determining risks that could potentially prevent the program, enterprise, or investment from achieving its objectives. It includes documenting and communicating the concern.

Risk identification is the critical first step of the risk management process.

`Risk = Asset + Threat + Vulnerability`

- If there is no threat, there is no vulnerability.
- If there is no vulnerability, there is no risk.
- If the asset has no value, there is no risk.

!!!
In some cases, the asset is excluded from the risk calculation. The asset should always be included in the calculation because you do not want to spend more money than the asset is worth to protect it.
