=== Event
According to the ITIL framework, an event is defined as a change of state that has significance for the management of an IT service or other CI. This could be any unscheduled adverse impact to the operating environment.

Events are anything that occur in the IT framework. As a result, the term can also be used to mean an alert or notification created by an IT service, CI, or monitoring tool.

Events often require IT operations staff to take actions and lead to incidents being logged.

## Summary

Incident management *deals with minimizing the impact to the business*.

Incident management describes the activities of an organization to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future reoccurrence. Incident management is typically involved in an initial attack and resolution of the attack. Identifying the root cause of the attack and deploying a fix to a known error is part of problem management.

Within a structured organization, an IRT or IMT typically addresses these types of incidents.

!!!
Incident management should be focused on the identification, classification, investigation, and resolution of an incident, with the ultimate goal of *returning the effected systems to normal as soon as possible*.
