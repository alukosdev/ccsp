# Availability Management

## Overview

Availability management aims to define, analyze, plan, measure, and improve all aspects of the availability of IT services. It is also responsibility for ensuring that all IT infrastructure, processes, tools, roles, and so on, are appropriate for the agreed-upon availability targets.

Most virtualization platforms allow for the management of system availability and can act in the event of a system outage (such as vMotion).
