=== Change Management
Change management must approve changes to all SLAs as well as ensure that the legal function has a chance to review them and offer guidance and direction on the nature and language of the proposed changes prior to them taking place. There should never be a change that is allowed to take place to an SLA that governs a production system unless change management has approved the change first.
