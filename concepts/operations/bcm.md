## Overview

Business continuity management *deals with planning, redundancy, criticality analysis, and sustaining the long-term operations of the business*.

BCM is focused on the planning steps that businesses engage in to ensure that their mission-critical systems are able to be restored to service following a disaster or service interruption event.

To focus BCM activities correctly, a prioritized ranking or listing of systems and services must be created and maintained. This is accomplished through the BIA, which identifies and produces a prioritized listing of systems and services critical to the normal functioning of the business.
