# Capacity Management

## Summary

Capacity management *deals with scalability and elasticity*.

Capacity management is focused on ensuring that the business IT infrastructure is adequately provisioned to deliver the agreed service-level targets in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Capacity management considers all resources required to deliver IT services within the scope of the defined business requirements. System capacity must be monitored and thresholds must be set to prevent systems from reaching an over-capacity situation.
