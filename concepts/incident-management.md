## Summary

Incident management *deals with minimizing the impact to the business*.

Incident management describes the activities of an organization to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future reoccurrence. Incident management is typically involved in an initial attack and resolution of the attack. Identifying the root cause of the attack and deploying a fix to a known error is part of problem management.

Within a structured organization, an IRT or IMT typically addresses these types of incidents.

Incident management should be focused on the identification, classification, investigation, and resolution of an incident, with the ultimate goal of *returning the effected systems to normal as soon as possible*.
