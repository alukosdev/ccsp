## Business Requirements

### Quick Reference

#### Business Requirements
A business requirement is an operational driver for decision making and input for risk management.

#### Business Rules

Business rules are lists of statements that tell you whether you may or may not do anything or that give you the criteria and conditions for making a decision.

#### Scoping

Scoping is the process that refers to including only departments or business units impacted by any (cloud) engagement.

### Overview

Security activities actually hinder business efficiency (because generally the more secure something is, be it a device or a process, the less efficient it will be). This is why the business needs of the organization drive security decisions, and not the other way around.

1. Gather business requirements
2. Perform business impact analysis

#### Involvement and Alignment

- Involvement from business units and alignment of IT processes/services with those units.
- The success of our services is based on the success of the business.
- Are we delivering the value we're expected to?

#### Quantifying Benefits and Opportunity Cost

- Reduction in Capital Expenditure
- Reduction in Personnel Costs
- Reduction in Operational Costs
- Transferring Some Regulatory Costs
- Reduction in Costs for Data Archival/Backup Services

### Types of Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

Those performance aspects of a device, process, or employee that are necessary for the business task to be accomplished. Example: A salesperson in the field must be able to connect to the organization's network remotely.

#### Nonfunctional Requirements

Those aspects of a device, process, or employee that are not necessary for accomplishing a business task but are desired or expected. For example: The salesperson's remote connection must be secure.

## Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

### Overview

The business impact analysis gathers asset valuation information that is beneficial for risk analysis and selection of security controls, and criticality information that helps in BC/DR planning by letting the organization understand which systems, data, and personnel are necessary to continuously maintain. It is an assessment of the priorities given to each asset and process within the organization.

It is based off the assumption that there are certain things the business needs to know in order to decide how they will handle risks within our organization.

The BIA is the basis of almost everything done with the organization. Business processes are based on the criticality of assets identified as a result of the BIA. A proper analysis should consider the effect (impact) any harm or loss of each asset might mean to the organization overall. Assets can be tangible or intangible.

#### Goals

- *Identify critical business processes and dependencies.* Such as determining RPOs and RTOs.
- *Identify risks and threats.* Such as CSP failure.
- *Identify requirements.* These may come from senior management, regulations, or a combination of both.

### Components

#### Inventory of Assets

We must understand what assets exist before we begin to determine their value.

#### Valuation of Assets

We determine a value for every asset (usually in terms of dollars), what it would cost the organization if we lost that asset (either temporarily or permanently), what it would cost to replace or repair that asset, and any alternate methods for dealing with that loss.

A proper analysis should consider the effect ("impact") any harm or loss of each asset might mean to the organization overall. Special care should be paid to identifying critical paths and single points of failure.

#### Determination of Criticality

Criticality denotes those aspects of the organization without which the organization could not operate or exist.

##### Tangible Assets

The organization is a rental car company; cars are critical to its operations-if it has no cars to rent to customers, it can't do business.

##### Intangible Assets

The organization is a music production firm; music is the intellectual property of the company-if the ownership of the music is compromised (for instance, if the copyright is challenged and the company loses ownership, or the encryption protecting the music files is removed and the music can be copied without protection), the company has nothing of value and will not survive.

##### Processes

The organization is a fast-food restaurant noted for its speed; the process of taking orders, preparing and delivering food, and taking payment is critical to its operations-if the restaurant cannot complete the process for some reason (for instance, the registers fail so that the restaurant cannot accept payment), the restaurant cannot function.

##### Data Pathways

The organization is an international shipping line; matching orders to cargo carriers is critical to its operations. If the company cannot complete its logistical coordination-assigning cargo requests to carriers with sufficient capacity-it cannot provide its services, and will not survive.

##### Personnel

The organization is a surgical provider; the surgeon is critical to the existence of the company-if the surgeon cannot operate, there is no company.
