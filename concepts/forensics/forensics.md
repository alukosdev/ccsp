# Forensics

## Quick Reference

==- Cloud Computing Forensic Science
The application of scientific principles, technological practices, and derived and proven methods to reconstruct past cloud computing events through identification, collection, preservation, examination, interpretation, and reporting of digital evidence.
==- Digital Forensics
Digital forensics is generally considered the application of science to the identification, collection, examination, and analysis of data while preserving the integrity of the information and maintaining a strict chain of custody for the data.
==- Forensic Science
Forensic science is generally defined as the application of science to the law.
==- Network Forensics
Network forensics is defined as the capture, storage, and analysis of network events. The idea is to capture every packet of network traffic and make it available in a single searchable database so that the traffic can be examined and analyzed in detail.

### Standards

The goal of the following standards is to promote best practices for the acquisition and investigation of digital evidence.

| Standard | Description |
| - | - |
| ISO/IEC 27037	| Guide for collecting, identifying, and preserving electronic evidence |
| ISO/IEC 27041 | Guide for incident investigations |
| ISO/IEC 27042 | Guide for digital evidence analysis |
| ISO/IEC 27043 | Incident investigation principles and processes |
| ISO/IEC 27050 | Overview and principles for eDiscovery |

## Summary

Challenges with forensics:

- Control over data (trustworthiness)
- Multitenancy
- Data volatility
- Evidence acquisition

Access to data will be decided by the following:

- The service model
- The legal system in the country where data is legally stored

!!!
There are certain jurisdictions where forensic data/IT analysis requires licensure (Texas, Colorado, and Michigan, for example).
