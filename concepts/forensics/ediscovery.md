ESI | Electronically Stored Information

eDiscovery refers to any process in which electronic data is sought, located, secured, and searched with the intent of using it as evidence in a civil or criminal legal case.

Typically, eDiscovery refers to the process of identifying and obtaining electronic evidence for either *prosecutorial or litigation purposes*.

You do not want to use unique testing techniques because those may not be repeatable or accepted by other experts (or the court).

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a party to litigation to preserve and produce electronically stored information in its possession, custody, or control. This can be very difficult when data is dispersed across many geophysical locations.

!!!
The difference between *data discovery* and *eDiscovery* is that data discovery is typically used for big data or analytics whereas eDiscovery is used for evidence.
