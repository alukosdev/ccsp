# Data Classification

## Summary

Data is classified based on its *value or sensitivity level*. This is performed in the *create phase* of the data lifecycle.

Data classification can be defined as a tool for categorization of data to help an organization effectively answer the following questions:

- What data types are available?
- Where is certain data located?
- What access levels are implemented?
- What protection level is implemented, and does it adhere to compliance regulations?

Virtualization has the potential to affect data classification processes and implementations in the cloud. Data transforming from raw objects to virtualized instances to snapshotted images back into virtualized instances and then back out to the users in the form of raw data may affect the organization's current classification methodology. Techniques and tools that were suitable for the traditional IT environment might not withstand the standard cloud environment.

!!!
The purpose of classification is to dictate *how to protect data*. You protect top-secret data differently than you protect secret data.
