Data custodians are responsible for the safe custody, transport, data storage, and implementation of business rules. This is any organization or person who manipulates, stores, or moves the data on behalf of the data owner.

The custodian is usually a specific entity in charge of maintaining and securing the privacy-related data on a *daily basis*, as an element of the data's use; for example, this could be a database administrator hired by the CSP.

The data custodian must adhere to any policies set forth by the data owner in regard to the use of the data.
