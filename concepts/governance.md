# Governance

## Quick Reference

=== Loss of Governance
The risk that the client cedes control to the cloud provider.
===

## Overview

Governance is the system by which the provisioning and usage of cloud services are directed and controlled. Governance defines actions, assigns responsibilities, and verifies performance. Governance includes the policy, process, and internal controls that comprise how an organization is run. Everything from the structures and policies to the leadership and other mechanisms for management.

Governance provides oversight, foundation, direction, and support for the organization as a whole. This includes policies, mission statements, how issues are addressed, and so on. The fact that any issue actually requires addressing is outline by governance. Governance identifies what the organization needs to do to please their stakeholders, prioritize performance vs. security, and so on.

## Corporate Governance

Corporate governance is a broad area describing the relationship between the shareholders and other stakeholders in the organization versus the senior management of the corporation.

## Third-Party Governance

Like our organization, CSPs also have governance. We do not want to sacrifice our governance in favor of theirs. For example, think of third-party governance for a CSP.

- Who reviews SLAs?
- How is this accomplished?
- Who reviews whether the metrics outlined in the SLA are actually being met?

Governance is making sure we have the right goals and that we have the supporting structure in place to achieve those goals. Do we have good third-party governance? Does our CSP have good governance?

## Contracts

### Quick Reference

=== Memorandium of Agreement/Understanding (MOA/MOU)
A *nonbinding* agreement between two or more parties outlining the terms and details of an understanding, including each parties' requirements and responsibilities.
===
Letter of Intent (LOI)
A LOI outlines the general plans of an agreement between two or more parties before a legal agreement is finalized.
===

### Overview

The contract will spell out all the terms of the agreement: what each party is responsible for, what form the services will take, how issues will be resolved, and so on. The contract will also state what the penalties are (usually financial) when the cloud provider fails to meet the SLA for a given period.

> The provider will ensure the customer has constant, uninterrupted access to the Customer's data storage resources. Customer's monthly fee will be waived for any period following a calendar month in which any service level has not been attained by the Provider.

The contract defines all the terms of an agreement with a cloud provider, including what each party is responsible for, what form the services will take, how issues will be resolved, and so on.

Contract management is all about third-party governance.

From a contractual, regulated, and PII perspective, the following should be reviewed and fully understood with regard to any hosting contracts (along with other overarching components within an SLA):

=== Scope of processing
Clear understanding of the permissible types of data processing should be provided. The specifications should also list the purpose for which the data can be processed or utilized.
=== Use of subcontractors
Understanding where any processing, transmission, storage, or use of information will occur.
=== Deletion of data
Where the business operations no longer require information to be retained for a specific purpose, the deletion of information should occur in line with the organizations data retention policies and standards.
=== Appropriate or required data security controls
Where processing, transmission, or storage of data and resources is outsourced, the same level of security controls should be required for any entry's contracting or subcontracting services.
Locations of data. Where information is being stored, processed, and transmitted in the event of daily actions or failover.
=== Return or restitution of data
For both contractors and subcontractors where a contract is terminated, the timely and orderly return of data has to be required both contractually and within the SLA.
=== Right to audit subcontractors
Right to audit clauses should allow for the organization owning the data (not possessing) to audit or engage the services of an independent party to ensure that contractual and regulatory requirements are being satisfied by either the contractor or the subcontractor.
===

At a minimum, you should ensure that your cloud service contract states that you must be notified in the event of a subpoena or other similar actions to ensure that you do not lose access to your data as a result of lawsuits.

Immediate notification from a CSP to a customer should be required for all security related events. This is especially true for security breaches. This should be explicitly addressed in the service contract between the client and the CSP and should be non-negotiable.

## Policies

### Overview

Policies are one of the foundational elements of a governance and risk management program. They guide the organization, based on standards and guidelines. Policies ensure that the organization is operating within its risk profile. Policies actually define, or are the expression of, the organization.

The designing and implementing of security policies is carried out with input from senior management.

### Organizational Policies

Organizational policies take the form of those intended to reduce exposure and minimize risk of financial and data losses, as well as other types of damages such as loss of reputation.

Organizational policies form the basis of functional policies that can reduce the likelihood of the following:

- Financial loss
- Irretrievable loss of data
- Reputational damage
- Regulatory and legal consequences
- Misuse and abuse of systems and resources

#### Functional Policies

Functional policies are particularly useful for organizations that have a well-engrained and fully operational ISMS:

- Information security policy
- Information technology policy
- Data classification policy
- Acceptable usage policy
- Network security policy
- Internet use policy
- Email use policy
- Password policy
- Virus and spam policy
- Software security policy
- Data backup policy
- Disaster recovery (DR) policy
- Remote access policy
- Segregation of duties policy
- Third-party access policy
- Incident response and management policy
- Human resources security policy
- Employee background checks
- Legal compliance guidelines

#### Cloud Policies

As part of the review of cloud services, either during the development of the cloud strategy or during vendor reviews and discussions, the details and requirements should be expanded to compare or assess the required criteria as per existing policies.

- Password policies
- Remote access
- Encryption
- Third-party access
- Segregation of duties
- Incident management
- Data backup

All of these policies are an expression of management's strategic goals and objective with regard to managing and maintaining the risk profile of the organization.
