## Overview

The OECD published the first set of internationally accepted privacy principles and recently published a set of revised guidelines governing the protection of privacy and trans-border flows of personal data. These revised guidelines focus on the need to globally enhance privacy protection through improved interoperability and the need to protect privacy using a practical, risk-management-based approach.

According to the OECD, several new concepts have been introduced in the revised guidelines, including the following:

- *National privacy strategies.* While effective laws are essential, the strategic importance of privacy today also requires a multifaceted national strategy coordinated at the highest levels of government.
- *Privacy management programs.* These serve as the core operational mechanism through which organizations implement privacy protection.
- *Data security breach notification.*  This provision covers both notice to an authority and notice to an individual affected by a security breach affecting personal data.

## Principles

The OECD identified the following Fair Information Practices:

- *Collection Limitation Principle.* There should be limits to the collection of personal data and any such data should be obtained by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the data subject.
- *Data Quality Principle.* Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete and kept up-to-date.
- *Purpose Specification Principle.* The purposes for which personal data are collected should be specified not later than at the time of data collection and the subsequent use limited to the fulfilment of those purposes or such others as are not incompatible with those purposes and as are specified on each occasion of change of purpose.
- *Use Limitation Principle.* Personal data should not be disclosed, made available or otherwise used for purposes other than with the consent of the data subject or by the authority of the law.
- *Security Safeguard Principle.* Personal data should be protected by reasonable security safeguards against such risks as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of data.
- *Openness Principle.* There should be a general policy of openness about developments, practices and policies with respect to personal data. Means should be readily available of establishing the existence and nature of personal data, and the main purposes of their use, as well as the identity and usual residence of the data controller.
- *Individual Participation Principle.* An individual should have several rights surrounding their data, such as obtaining the data without excessive financial charges and challenging data relating to the subject, and if the challenge is successful to have the data erased, rectified, completed or amended.
- *Accountability Principle.* A data controller should be accountable for complying with measures which give effect to the principles stated above.

The OECD principles do not include "the right to be forgotten" as the EU does.
