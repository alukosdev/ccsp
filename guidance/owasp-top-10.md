## Web Application Security Risks

!!!
To address these risks, organizations must have an application risk management program in place. Implementation of an application risk management program addresses not only vulnerabilities but also all risks associated with applications.
!!!

==- Broken Access Control
<span id="rev1"></span>Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the user's limits.[[ยน]](#ref1)

+++ Notable CWEs
- CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
- CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
- CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery

==- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
<span id="rev1"></span>SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL).

As modern web applications provide end-users with convenient features, fetching a URL becomes a common scenario. As a result, the incidence of SSRF is increasing. Also, the severity of SSRF is becoming higher due to cloud services and the complexity of architectures.[[ยนโฐ]](#ref10)

+++ Notable CWEs
The data shows a relatively low incidence rate with above average testing coverage and above-average Exploit and Impact potential ratings.

==- Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
+++ Notable CWEs
CWE does not cover the limitations of human processes and procedures that cannot be described in terms of a specific technical weakness as resident in the code, architecture, or configuration of the software. Since "known vulnerabilities" can arise from any kind of weakness, it is not possible to map this OWASP category to other CWE entries, since it would effectively require mapping this category to ALL weaknesses.[https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1035.html]
