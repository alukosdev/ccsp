## Overview

Includes the CCSL and CCSM which, together, aid in selecting a certification scheme for cloud computing customers.

## Components

### CCSL

The Cloud Certification Schemes List (CCSL) provides an overview of different existing certification schemes. It describes the main characteristics relevant to cloud computing and cloud computing customers.

CCSL answers questions like these:

1. Part 1 - General information about the certification scheme
2. Part 2 - Which are the underlying security standards or best practices?
3. Part 3 - Assessments and certification of compliance (such as which organizations are accredited to issue certificates)
4. Part 4 - Current adoption and usage (such as how many providers have obtained certification)
5. Part 5 - Security objectives

The schemes that make up the CCSL include:

- Certified Cloud Service - TUV Rhineland
- CSA Attestation - OCF level 2
- CSA Certification - OCF level 2
- CSA Self-Assessment - OCF level 1
- EuroCloud Self-Assessment (ECSA Self-Assessment)
- EuroCloud Star Audit Certification (ECSA Audit)
- ISO/IEC 27001 Certification
- PCI DSS v3.1
- LEET Security Rating Guide
- AICPA SOC 1
- AICPA SOC 2
- AICPA SOC 3

### CCSM

The Cloud Certification Schemes Metaframework (CCSM) is an extension of the CCSL designed to provide a high-level mapping of security requirements of the customer to security objectives in existing cloud security schemes. There are 27 CCSM security objectives that the customer can select to cross-reference against.

The CCSM is basically a comparison matrix/table of the CCSL schemes and the CCSM security objectives which displays whether certain framework contains a certain objective (such as risk management). The matrix allows for easy visibility into whether a particular framework contains what a cloud customer may require.
