# STRIDE

## Overview

Created by Microsoft, the STRIDE threat model provides a standardized way of describing threats by their attributes. It is used to parse the various types of attacks and malicious techniques that might be used against software.

STRIDE is particularly useful as part of the software development lifecycle in attempting to identify vulnerabilities throughout the build process. These six concepts help in identifying and classifying threats or vulnerabilities and help form a common language used to describe them.

The attributes include:

- Spoofing
- Tampering
- Repudiation
- Information Disclosure
- Denial of Service
- Elevation of Privilege

## Attributes

### [S]poofing

Attacker assumes identity of subject.

### [T]ampering

### [R]epudiation

Illegitimate denial of an event.

### [I]nformation Disclosure

Information obtained without authorization.

### [D]enial of Service

Attacker overloads system to deny legitimate access.

### [E]levation of Privilege

Attacker gains a privilege level above what is permitted.
