## Overview

*Cloud Computing: Benefits, risks, and recommendations for information security* is a paper published by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) that identifies and categorizes *35 security risks* related to cloud computing. From these risks, it further identifies the *top eight* security risks based on likelihood and impact. This paper allows an informed assessment of the security risks and benefits of using cloud computing - providing security guidance for potential and existing users of cloud computing.

## Risks

!!!
Risks **bolded** below indicate the *top eight security risks* based on likelihood and impact. These risks do not follow a specific order of criticality; they are just eight of the most important cloud computing specific risks identified during the assessment.
!!!

==- Policy and organizational risks

- **R.1 Lock-in**
- **R.2 Loss of governance**
- **R.3 Compliance challenges**
- R.4 Loss of business reputation due to co-tenant activities
- R.5 Cloud service termination or failure
- R.6 Cloud provider acquisition
- R.7 Supply chain failure

==- Technical risks

- R.8 Resource exhaustion (under or over provisioning)
- **R.9 Isolation failure**
- **R.10 Cloud provider malicious insider - abuse of high privilege roles**
- **R.11 Management interface compromise (manipulation, availability of infrastructure)**
- R.12 Intercepting data in transit
- R.13 Data leakage on up/download, intra-cloud
- **R.14 Insecure or ineffective deletion of data**
- R.15 Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
- R.16 Economic denial-of-service (EDoS)
- R.17 Loss of encryption keys
- R.18 Undertaking malicious probes of scans
- R.19 Compromise service engine
- R.20 Conflicts between customer hardening procedures and cloud environment

==- Legal risks

- R.21 Subpoena and e-discovery
- R.22 Risk from changes of jurisdiction
- **R.23 Data protection risks**
- R.24 Licensing risk

==- Risks not specific to the cloud

- R.25 Network breaks
- R.26 Network management (i.e., network congestion/misconnection/non-optimal use)
- R.27 Modifying network traffic
- R.28 Privilege escalation
- R.29 Social engineering attacks (i.e., impersonation)
- R.30 Loss of compromise of operational logs
- R.31 Loss or compromise of security logs (manipulation of forensice investigation)
- R.32 Backups lost, stolen
- R.33 Unauthorized access to premises (including physical access to machines and other facilities)
- R.34 Theft of computer equipment
- R.35 Natural disasters
