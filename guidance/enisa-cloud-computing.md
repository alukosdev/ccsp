## Overview

> Fix the below verbiage

*Cloud Computing: Benefits, risks, and recommendations for information security* is a framework that identifies and categorizes *35 types of risks* organizations should consider. It further identifies the *top eight* security risks based on likelihood and impact.

ENISA is a standard and model developed in Europe and is responsible for producing *Cloud Computing: Benefits, Risks, and Recommendations for Information Security*. It identifies *35 types of risks* organizations should consider but goes further by identifying the *top eight security risks* based on likelihood and impact:

## Risks

### Risk Categories

- Policy and organizational risks
- Technical risks
- Legal risks
- Risks not specific to the cloud

==- Policy and organizational risks

- R.1 Lock-in
- R.2 Loss of governance
- R.3 Compliance challenges
- R.4 Loss of business reputation due to co-tenant activities
- R.5 Cloud service termination or failure
- R.6 Cloud provider acquisition
- R.7 Supply chain failure

==- Technical risks

- R.8 Resource exhaustion (under or over provisioning)
- R.9 Isolation failure
- R.10 Cloud provider malicious insider - abuse of high privilege roles
- R.11 Management interface compromise (manipulation, availability of infrastructure)
- R.12 Intercepting data in transit
- R.13 Data leakage on up/download, intra-cloud
- R.14 Insecure or ineffective deletion of data
- R.15 Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
- R.16 Economic denial-of-service (EDoS)
- R.17 Loss of encryption keys
- R.18 Undertaking malicious probes of scans
- R.19 Comproimise service engine
- R.20 Conflicts between customer hardening procedures and cloud environment

==- Legal risks

- R.21 Subpoena and e-discovery
- R.22 Risk from changes of jurisdiction
- R.23 Data protection risks
- R.24 Licensing risk

==- Risks not specific to the cloud

- R.25 Network breaks
- R.26 Network management (i.e., network congestion/misconnection/non-optimal use)
- R.27 Modifying network traffic
- R.28 Privilege escalation
- R.29 Social engineering attacks (i.e., impersonation)
- R.30 Loss of compromise of operational logs
- R.31 Loss or compromise of security logs (manipulation of forensice investigation)
- R.32 Backups lost, stole
- R.33 Unauthorized access to premises (including physical access to machines and other facilities)
- R.34 Theft of computer equipment
- R.35 Natural disasters

### Top Security Risks

- Loss of governance
- Lock-in
- Isolation failure
- Compliance risks
- Management interface compromise
- Data protection
- Insecure or incomplete data deletion
- Malicious insider

## Noteworthy

- [x] The Cloud Computing framework contains *35 types of risks*.
- [x] The Cloud Computing framework identifies the *top eight security risks* based on likelihood and impact.
