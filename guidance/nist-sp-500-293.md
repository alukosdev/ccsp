## Overview

SP 500-293, formally known as the "US Government Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap" and referred to simply as "the Roadmap,” contains ten high-level priority requirements in security, interoperability, and portability for the government’s adoption of cloud computing.[[¹]](#ref1)

## Requirements

The USG Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap requirements which are identified as high priorities to further USG Cloud Computing Technology Adoption are:

=== Requirement 1
International voluntary consensus-based standards (interoperability, performance, portability, and security standards)
=== Requirement 2
Solutions for High-priority Security Requirements, technically de-coupled from organizational policy decisions (security standards and technology)
=== Requirement 3
Technical specifications to enable development of consistent, high-quality Service-Level Agreements (interoperability, performance, portability, and security standards and guidance)
=== Requirement 4
Clearly and consistently categorized cloud services (interoperability and portability guidance and technology)
=== Requirement 5
 Frameworks to support seamless implementation of federated community cloud environments (interoperability and portability guidance and technology)
=== Requirement 6
 Updated Organization Policy that reflects the Cloud Computing Business and Technology model (security guidance)
=== Requirement 7
Defined unique government regulatory requirements and solutions (accessibility, interoperability, performance, portability, and security technology)
=== Requirement 8
Collaborative parallel strategic “future cloud” development initiatives (interoperability, portability, and security technology)
=== Requirement 9
Defined and implemented reliability design goals (interoperability, performance, portability, and security technology)
=== Requirement 10
Defined and implemented cloud service metrics (interoperability, performance, and portability standards)
===
