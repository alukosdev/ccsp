## Overview

<span id="rev1"></span>SP 500-293, formally known as the "US Government Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap" and referred to simply as "the Roadmap,” contains ten high-level priority requirements in security, interoperability, and portability for the government’s adoption of cloud computing.[[¹]](#ref1)

## Requirements

The USG Cloud Computing Technology Roadmap requirements which are identified as high priorities to further USG Cloud Computing Technology Adoption are:

- *Requirement 1*. International voluntary consensus-based standards (interoperability, performance, portability, and security standards)
- *Requirement 2*. Solutions for High-priority Security Requirements, technically de-coupled from organizational policy decisions (security standards and technology)
- *Requirement 3*. Technical specifications to enable development of consistent, high-quality Service-Level Agreements (interoperability, performance, portability, and security standards and guidance)
- *Requirement 4*. Clearly and consistently categorized cloud services (interoperability and portability guidance and technology)
- *Requirement 5*. Frameworks to support seamless implementation of federated community cloud environments (interoperability and portability guidance and technology)
- *Requirement 6*. Updated Organization Policy that reflects the Cloud Computing Business and Technology model (security guidance)
- *Requirement 7*. Defined unique government regulatory requirements and solutions (accessibility, interoperability, performance, portability, and security technology)
- *Requirement 8*. Collaborative parallel strategic “future cloud” development initiatives (interoperability, portability, and security technology)
- *Requirement 9*. Defined and implemented reliability design goals (interoperability, performance, portability, and security technology)
- *Requirement 10*. Defined and implemented cloud service metrics (interoperability, performance, and portability standards)
