## Overview

The Cloud Certification Schemes Metaframework (CCSM) is an extension of the CCSL designed to provide a high-level mapping of security requirements of the customer to security objectives in existing cloud security schemes. There are 27 CCSM security objectives that the customer can select to cross-reference against.

The CCSM is basically a comparison matrix/table of the CCSL schemes and the CCSM security objectives which displays whether certain framework contains a certain objective (such as risk management). The matrix allows for easy visibility into whether a particular framework contains what a cloud customer may require.

CCSM is a metaframework, which maps detailed security requirements used in the public sector to describe security objectives in existing cloud certification schemes. The goal of CCSM is to provide more transparency about certification schemes and to help customers with procurement of cloud computing services.
It covers **27 security objectives**, and maps these to **5 cloud certification schemes**.
CCSM is the second tool, and extension of CCSL.

The tool maps different certification schemes to a single list of security objectives. The tool allows customers to choose the security objectives most relevant to them, and

generate a matrix mapping to different cloud certification schemes, and/or
generate procurement checklists or questionaires as printouts or spreadsheets.
Next steps for CCSM might be to include NIS requirements from other countries and to extend the scope of CCSM to include also NIS requirements specific for personal data protection.

!!!
Together, the CCSL and CCSM aid in selecting a certification scheme for cloud computing customers.
